## jstips-xe: Extended expositions of selected JS Tips

First, hats off to the [JS Tips](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips) team for putting together a useful collection of JavaScript tips that
>will allow you to improve your code writing [in] less than 2 minutes

I'm an occasional tip editor, and ever so often, I run across a tip that cries out for a long explanation that can't fit in 2 minutes. This is a collection of those explanations, mostly for my own edification, but hopefully somewhat useful to you, dear reader.

Original Tip # | Extended Exposition
------|----------------------------
[33: Create Range 0...(N-1) easily using one line](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips/blob/gh-pages/_posts/en/2016-02-02-create-range-0...n-easily-using-one-line.md) | [High Magic Solution 1 explained](tips/33.md)
[18: Truncating the fast (but risky) way](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips/blob/gh-pages/_posts/en/2016-01-18-rounding-the-fast-way.md) | ["32 bits ought to be enough for anybody"](tips/18.md)

### How Can I Help?
If you feel that a tip needs a better explanation, see if someone else has already asked [over on JS Tips](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips/issues), and raise a new issue if necessary. I'll see if I can help with that, and if so, whether I'll:
* contribute an update PR to the tip over there, or
* write my own explanation here.

If you think these expositions are faulty or unclear, [raise an issue](https://github.com/gromgit/jstips-xe/issues). Better yet, submit an update PR so everyone can benefit.
